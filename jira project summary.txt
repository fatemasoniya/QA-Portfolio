Project: Bug Reporting using JIRA

 Description:
This project was done to simulate a real-world bug tracking environment using JIRA Cloud. Bugs were identified from a sample project and documented using industry-standard formats.

- Added Priority, Severity, Labels
- Attached Screenshots to each ticket
- Maintained consistent bug reporting format

 Tools Used:
